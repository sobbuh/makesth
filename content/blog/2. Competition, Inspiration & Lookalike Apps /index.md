What you should have now: 

	- A short pitch for your app
	- Why you are doing this 
	- An idea for your MVP 
	- A list of jobs that your users want to accomplish

I had a few people reach out to me with a few questions from part 1

*How to decide on an idea?* 

If it’s your first project, focus on a need you have. This way, you are your own user and have a good idea of the problems you are having. 

Understanding users is hard, and if you are the user, that makes it a lot easier. Your problem then is to understand where your needs overlap with other users and how to generalize your problems to a larger audience. 

In this case, you are focusing on your specific strengths and insights. 

In the ideal case, you would also focus on: 

	- the market (what is the size of the market)
	- monetization (are people willing to pay for your solution)
	- how monetizable is your earliest solution (i.e. what is your personal burn rate and runway — when do you need your solution to start making you money?) 
	- is it a painkiller or a vitamin 
	- how open is your audience to new solutions?  

In the ideal scenario, this is a learning experience without the need to make money. I know that isn’t possible for everyone — and ties into the next question: 

*What about monetization?*

Our goal is also to make something relatively small; so the need for monetization shouldn’t be so great. Monetization at scale can be a difficult problem.

In the end, monetization comes down to users having a job that they want to do that they are willing to pay money to solve it. 

In my experience, most people get caught up in trying to figure everything out from the start and never end up releasing something. My thought is that people need to learn these things for themselves, and by far the best way to learn is by doing.

Once you’ve gone through this process once, you will start asking better questions and hopefully start having better ideas.

Coming up with pain points that could be monetized requires understanding your users and their problems, motivations and desired outcomes. And I think the best way to do that is to create something and release it. The feedback you receive when releasing a product is much more valuable than through interviews or surveys. 

I think the time is better spent going through this process instead of constantly trying to validate ideas (which I think a lot of people get trapped in).

So, maybe your V1 isn’t monetizable, but if you have a large enough market with a strong enough problem that needs to be solved, you should be able to find a monetizable solution. 

If early monetization is an issue for you, that is something you will want to consider in your idea generation phase. Some questions to ask in that case are “is this something my users would be willing to pay for? Are they currently paying for another solution? Are other solutions too expensive so that they are priced out, but they might pay for a worse solution that costs less?”  These are questions you will want to ask perspective customers (more on that in User Interviews and Surveys, which won’t be part of the V1 for this workbook) 

*How to work as a team?*

Work through each part on your own, and then join together at the end. 

Using a note and vote system, decide which problems to focus on at each step. 

There should ideally be one person who has the final say on each point; and you would ideally keep discussions to a minimum to keep the process moving quickly.  

A lot of this is influenced by the Google Design Sprint framework. I would recommend reading up on that just so you have an idea of how the process works. You can google that or ‘note and vote’ to get more info on how those systems work.

Day 2 Objectives

- To understand a narrow view of your competition, and how your solution compares 

- To continue to think about the needs of your immediate users, and how to help them achieve their desired outcome

- To gather inspiration and lookalikes to use in your design and development

---

The goal of this section is to take a look at your competition, gather your inspiration and find some lookalike apps.

Each of these steps could take an infinite amount of time. Our goal is to limit that.

First, we’re going to focus on competitors. Spend 5-10 minutes searching for an answer to the problems you listed in part 1. Open each potential answer as a new tab, or just write a note. After we have them all, we’ll analyze our competition against our current ideas. 

---

*Tasks* 

## A. Competition

i. Who are your competitors? 


ii. How did you search for these competitors? What specific job were you trying to do when you were searching? How were you limiting your search?  


iii. What are the main problems your competitors solve?
(i.e. What jobs are the users doing when they are using your competitors?) 


Iv. From your list of jobs that you’ve written in part 1, go through your competitors and rate them on a score of 1-10 how well they do each job, and how hard it is to complete each job 


v. What are the ‘table stakes’ jobs that all competitors are doing for their users?  

vi. What are some features from your competitors that you would like to replicate? 

vii. How do you solve the problem differently from your competitors? What is your USP (unique sales proposition)?


## B. Inspiration & Lookalike apps

This is something you’ll want to do as you go around the web. Every time you use a useful site, nice design, or cool feature, take note of it (I use bear, where I keep a #examples folder).  Take screenshots of features that you like, or cool user experiences. 

I like to focus on simple things that are really pleasant to use (simple hopefully means easy to implement in this case, but it’s not always easy to judge that unless you have experience).   

Spend 5-10 minutes looking for inspiration and lookalike apps or sites. After that, spend a few minutes going through each app (5 minutes each should be enough) taking notes on interesting and useful features. 

i. Who are your inspiration & lookalike apps/sites? 


ii.  What do you like about each site/app?

*Task Explanations*


## A. Competition

*i. Who are your competitors?* 

When trying to find competitors, imagine that you are searching for a solution to a problem you have.  You want to focus on the actual problem you are solving for your customer. 

It’s best not to use sites like angel list, but that’s okay too. 

If you already know of competitors, be sure to include those as well. How are you currently solving the problem? What are your substitute solutions? 

*ii. How did you search for competitors?* 

This is important in keeping us on track and really understanding the problem that we’re trying to solve. 

*iii. What are the main problems your competitors solve for each user?* 
You want to think about the main problem that each competitor is solving — is it different than what you are solving? 

*Iv. From your list of jobs that you’ve written in part 1, go through your competitors and rate them on a score of 1-10 how well they do each job, and how hard it is to complete each job* 

which jobs are most important and are being satisfied. We’re going to do that ourselves. 

If you aren’t a user of the product that you’re creating, you’ll want to make sure you verify these assumptions through user testing, interviews and surveys. 


*v. What are the ‘table stakes’ jobs that all competitors are doing for their users?*  

These are jobs that all of the competitors are doing for their users. These are things you will want to make sure to include in all forms of your app, including your MVP unless you can be sure that they are not significant to your users (i.e. through user surveys and interviews, but more likely through user testing)

*vi. What are some features from your competitors that you would like to replicate?* 

Take screenshots and write notes about the specific features you think are useful. Think about how to improve these features, or to narrow them down to distill just the most valuable parts of the process. 

*vii. How do you solve the problem differently from your competitors? What is your USP (unique sales proposition)?*

You really want to test your assumptions here — is the problem you’re solving really important enough for someone to be looking for a new solution? 

## B. Inspiration & Lookalike apps

*i. Who are your inspiration & lookalike apps?* 

Inspiration apps or features are just that — ideas that you can use for inspiration when planning your solution. Lookalikes take it a step further; these are apps solving another problem that could be used easily to solve yours. This is good for your first project as it will give you a solid base to start from.

Generally we want to focus on functional requirements here, but it’s good to keep in mind any features that have an emotional benefit as well. 

*ii.  What do you like about each site/app?* 

Go over what it is exactly that you like about each site or feature, and why you find it good or useful. This will help you bring clarity to the exact parts of the app or site that you may want to incorporate into your solution.
