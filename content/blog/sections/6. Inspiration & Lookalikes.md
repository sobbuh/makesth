#### Tasks (with Instructions)**

**i. Who are your inspiration & lookalike apps?**


(Note: If you're making an IOS app, you'll want to become very familiar with the [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/), and for [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide). These are a great place to start.) 


Inspiration apps or features are just that â€” ideas that you can use for inspiration when planning your solution. Lookalikes take it a step further; these are apps solving another problem that could be used easily to solve yours. This is good for your first project as it will give you a solid base to start from.

Take screenshots! This will be helpful later on during the design process, especially if we choose to hire a designer. 

This is another process that could take infinite time. Instead, we're going to limit it to 10-15 minutes. Another key is to keep track of these things as you use apps and browse the internet. I keep a list of examples of great UX and UI that I like, so I have easy access to it later when I need it. 

Start with any apps that you use now; why do you use them? How do they make doing the task frictionless? 

You might want to use some of the following sites for ideas: 

[Mobbin](https://mobbin.design)
[Pttrns](https://pttrns.com/)
[Mobile Patterns](https://mobile-patterns.com/)
[Muzli Design Inspiration](https://muz.li/)
[Dribbbl](https://dribbble.com)
[Behance](https://Behance.com)

(know of another site that should be listed here? Let me know)

**ii.  What do you like about each site/app?** 

Go over what it is exactly that you like about each site or feature, and why you find it good or useful. This will help you bring clarity to the exact parts of the app or site that you may want to incorporate into your solution.
