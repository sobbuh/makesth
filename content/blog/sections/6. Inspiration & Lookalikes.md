#### Tasks (with Instructions)**

*i. Who are your inspiration & lookalike apps?* 

Inspiration apps or features are just that — ideas that you can use for inspiration when planning your solution. Lookalikes take it a step further; these are apps solving another problem that could be used easily to solve yours. This is good for your first project as it will give you a solid base to start from.

Generally we want to focus on functional requirements here, but it’s good to keep in mind any features that have an emotional benefit as well. 

*ii.  What do you like about each site/app?* 

Go over what it is exactly that you like about each site or feature, and why you find it good or useful. This will help you bring clarity to the exact parts of the app or site that you may want to incorporate into your solution.
