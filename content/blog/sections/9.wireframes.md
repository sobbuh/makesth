    - A list of users that we will target
    - A persona (based on user needs) for our first set of users
    - A user journey map for our first users
    - A list of assumptions and ways to de-risk those assumptions
    - A short description of your MRP
	- Feature Sets (v1, v2, icebox)
    - A list of your competitors

#### Objectives

- Prepare digital wireframes that can be used for prototype testing

---

#### Tasks

**1. Move to Sketch.**

**2. Fill out the remaining screens**

**3. Rename all of your screens and symbols.**

#### Tasks (with instructions)

Use Sketch(a mac-only app) or Figma(windows/Mac) <br/>
I like to use Sketch(personal preference) or Figma. There are specific apps for wireframes, but I don't think they're necessary. While sketch and figma are harder to use, and not exactly made for wireframing, if we set up our files correctly it will be easy to update the entire app once we're ready. We can actually use the work we do early on to make high-fidelity prototypes later (a high-fidelity prototype looks like our finished app). This will cut our costs down immensely. 

So, depending on how sure I am of my designs I will decide how to start. If you have no idea â€” start with pencil and paper. If you have a good idea, start with sketch. (starting with pencil and paper is always a good idea)
