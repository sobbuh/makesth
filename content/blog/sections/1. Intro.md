### What is this guide?  
 
This guide will walk you through the process of going from idea to app. We'll:
- choose an idea
- refine it
- design it
- test it
- outsource design + development
- test it
- market it
- launch it 
- grow it

### Why this guide?

There are probably other guides out there. This one is made to be:
- fast 
- solution-oriented
- focused on minimizing inputs and maximizing outputs
- accessible 
- example-based (examples coming soon; first one should be up sept 15, 2019)

We'll also focus on developing our mindset. 


### Why am I making this? 

To empower people (i.e. you) to make a difference. 

> My hypothesis: you understand your problems, and would be able to solve them best if you had the right processes and mindset. 

Lots of people have ideas for apps. Some of those ideas are bad, and some are good. But, having ideas doesn't get you anywhere. Acting on those ideas will help you learn the difference between a good and bad idea, and even help you turn your bad ideas into good ideas. How you approach a problem, design your solution and execute on it will make all the difference. **Doing is the best way to learn.**


### Who is this for? 

This was written specifically for non-technical founders. 

You don't need any skills to start, what you do need:
- a unique perspective (everyone has this, but you might need to work to find yours)
- a desire to learn (most people will say they have this)
- discipline to follow through (this is the tough one)

Our goal isn't to make millions with our first app, **our goal is to build something and to learn as we go.**

### Do I need money to start? 

No.

The less money you have the more you will have to do on your own, and the smaller your first project should be. This just means you will need to learn a diverse set of skills as we go, which is great.

Once we get to the point of hiring people, your job instead will be to find co-founders. Working through this guide should help you with that. 

### How does it work? 

We start with your idea and each section guides us through the process, step by step, of making something. Each section is broken down into several tasks with a time limit. 

If a task is taking too long, just stop where you are and move on to the next task, you can always circle back if you need to. Try to keep your forward momentum.

I may start selling this guide or related materials in the future, but for now, it's all free.  

### My Goal

This will hopefully change over time. As of Sept 1 '19, it's to have 20 apps developed using this guide.
