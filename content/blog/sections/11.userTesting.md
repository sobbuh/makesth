#### Tasks (with instructions)

1. Find Testers

It’s best if you can do this locally. Think about your initial users and where you can find them. 

There are a few places to find testers: meetup, facebook groups, craigslist. 

Meetup is a great place to start since these are local people, generally tech savvy, and segmented by their interests.

Here is an example of a post you might make: 

“Hi all, I’m attending on Monday and have an app prototype that I’d like to test with real life users. The app helps you _______________. If you have 5-10 minutes to spare before or after the meetup, let me know. I’m a senior product manager and I’d be happy to discuss any app or business ideas you have in exchange for your time” 



2. Run User Tests

3. Gather and Analyze your data

#### Outputs

1. Finding testers



2. Performing tests 

Hand the device to them with your invision mock ready. 

“I’m going to watch you use the app, so feel free to explore and use it as you would a regular app. If you can, voice out loud any thoughts in your head or questions you have as you are using the app. Once you’re done, just let me know. “


Have the user click on  the mock and ask them to explore the app. Tell them to let you know when they are done exploring.


Do not say anything until they are done

From this point on
