*One recommendation*

Super Book Recommendation: [Donâ€™t Make me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by Steve Krug. This book really hammers in the keys of user experience design. If you learn these ideas well, you can design a great app or website.

#### Tasks (with instructions)

**1. Sketch your ideas on paper**

Print out phone or web templates -- I use sketchize.com. 

From here, you're going to start with what you think is the main screen. 

Use your list from the screen-by-screen requirements to determine what goes on each screen, and use your 'importance values' to determine the size of it.

I like to use two colors, and sharpies: 
- Use one color for the main content, 
- one color for any buttons or main content that should be highlighted. 

You can use a third color, but usually that's a sign that there's too much going on (or maybe you're a better designer than me!)

Try to limit the time you spend on each screen, the idea is to get a rough outline. You don't want these to be perfect, just to get your ideas on paper. 

**2. Re-work your wireframes**

At this point, you can see your app coming together visually. Is there another way you could have done your screens to make it more simple & obvious for the user? 

We'll want to go through our user flows again, pretending we are a user. It's still early, we can still change things easily. How easy is it for a user to get the benefit they want from your app?
