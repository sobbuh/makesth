*One recommendation*

Super Book Recommendation: [Don’t Make me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by Steve Krug. This book really hammers in the keys of user experience design. If you learn these ideas well, you can design a great app or website.
