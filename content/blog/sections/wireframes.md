We’re going to start our wireframes .

We have two options to start. 

(1) using pencil and paper. <br/> 
I like to get sheets of paper that are the same scale as an iPhone (~1:2.6) or web (~1.55:1). Doesn’t need to be perfect, but I find having the scale right helps me visualize things a little easier. This is great if you're a beginner. 

(2) Use Sketch(a mac-only app) or Figma(windows/Mac) <br/>
I like to use Sketch(personal preference) or Figma. There are specific apps for wireframes, but I don't think they're necessary. While sketch and figma are harder to use, and not exactly made for wireframing, if we set up our files correctly it will be easy to update the entire app once we're ready. We can actually use the work we do early on to make high-fidelity prototypes later (a high-fidelity prototype looks like our finished app). This will cut our costs down immensely. 

So, depending on how sure I am of my designs I will decide how to start. If you have no idea — start with pencil and paper. If you have a good idea, start with sketch. (starting with pencil and paper is always a good idea)

Quick sidebar:

I think these are very worthwhile skills to learn for anyone who wants to be involved in app or web development long term. Of course, your design sense may need work,but if we stick to the iOS and Android standards for the most part, and learn from apps that we enjoy using then we have a great starting point. 

*A few recommendations*
Super Book Recommendation: Don’t Make me Think, by Steve Krug. This book really hammers in the keys of user experience design. If you learn these ideas well, you can design a great app or website.

*Key*<br/>

Our focus right now is to move quickly and cheaply. The more time and money you put into your idea now, the more stuck to it you’ll become. You want to be flexible about your ideas. Be open to changing them. The less time/money you spend, the more free you will be to make changes and adaptations. 

Look at any time spent working on your app as an investment into yourself, not an investment into this specific app. Keep yourself open to changing the app as you go along.
