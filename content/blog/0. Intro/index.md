### Why am I making this? 

To empower people (i.e. you!) to make a difference. You understand your problems, and would probably be able to solve them best if given the right processes and mindset. 

I believe in your ability to change the world around you (hopefully for the better).

### Who is this for? 

This is mainly for non-technical founders, but it could be useful for anyone (including teams, but this first version is made for individual founders). If you are new to app development, or just want to see another way of having an app made & marketed, this is for you. 

### Why is this necessary? 

There might be other options that work better for you. Maybe I haven't seen all of the possible options.

I am going to walk you through the production of an app to show you that it is possible. Meanwhile, we'll develop the skills and mindset necessary to run this process effectively. 

### Why is this free? 

I'll probably charge for this later (people are more likely to follow through if they pay for it). 
In the meantime, just imagine you've paid a ridiculous amount of money for this and let's get started.
